This directory contains the CSS file for all SEED projects. 
The SEED CSS does not contain all of its class (it only contains the bare minimum).
If you are selecting to add a plugin to your seedProject from the full version you will need 
to do the following:

- Copy the related JS files to your SeedProject from the Full_Version
- Open LESS or SASS directory and open "smartadmin-production-plugins.less"
- Then enable the plugin you would want to use
- And finally compile the LESS/SASS file to get the desired CSS file.
- Copy the compiled CSS and paste it over to your seedProject (replacing its predecessor)
